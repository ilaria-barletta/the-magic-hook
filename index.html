            <h2>About me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome everyone!</p>
            <p>This is a magical place, really. One that I would have loved to find myself when, during the first lockdown of my life, I decided I wanted to become a crochet master.</p>
            <p>My name is Ilaria, I have always loved crafts and creativity has been with me my whole life.</p>
            <p>If you have a passion for wool and hooks or if you are simply considering to learn a new skill and crochet interests you, this is your place.</p>
            <p>Here we'll go through the basics, you'll understand quickly what you need to start and how to decide what materials to use for your work.</p>
            <p>I'll give you some templates to follow as well, simple instructions that will take you from zero to hero in no time.</p>
            <p> Follow me and get in touch, maybe we'll meet at the next workshop.</p>
            <p>Hooks at the ready now,let's do some magic!<i class="fa-solid fa-hat-wizard"></i></p>

                <h2>Tools </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Yarn:</b>To start, pick something thick, acryic or wool, in a bright color.</li>
                    <li><b>Hook:</b>Every hook has a number and each yarn has a label. Pick an hook that matches the number recommended on label. Or bigger.</li>
                    <li><b>Scissors:</b>Online you'll find amazing arts&crafts scissors. Some are even shaped like birds. The truth is that any scissor, will do the job.</li>
                    <li><b>Stitch markers:</b>They are sold in little boxes and are really useful when you start not to skip chains or even when you know more, but the pattern is triky</li>
                    <li><b>Measuring tape:</b>It will come handy when you need to check the lenght of your scarves, the width of your jumpers or to see how many chains fit in, let's say 30 cm.</li>
                    <li><b>Wool needles:</b>These look a lot like normal needles but are bigger and there is no pointed tip. You'll need one to refine your work.</li>
                    <li><b>Extra amigurumi material:</b>There can be safety eyes, colorful threads to embroider mouths and cheeks,filling.</li>
